# Mission-to-Mars
## Introduction
This project contains two main deliverables - scraping article titles and preview text from <a href="https://redplanetscience.com/" target="_blank"> Mars Temperature Data Site</a> and scraping and analyzing Mars weather data from <a href="https://data-class-mars-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html" target="_blank">Mars Temperature Data Site</a>.
### Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
In this deliverable, I initially scraped the date from the website using the provided URL. After that, data were organized using the Beautiful Soup python module in Jupyter. Titles and preview texts of all articls from the website were extracted and saved into a list of dictionaries, which were later saved and exported into a JSON file. Following that, I analyzed and then visualized the data.
